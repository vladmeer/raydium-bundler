## Overview
This bundler leverages Jito to streamline Solana transactions by allowing you to batch up to 4 transactions in a single bundle. It enables seamless token creation, buying, and selling across 21 wallets, all within a few steps.

## How the Bundler Works:
1. Create a Token (Customize Metadata)
Start by creating a new token along with its metadata. This is the foundation for your transaction.

2. Create a Market
Set up a market for your token so that you can start trading.

3. Generate Wallets for Pool Purchases
Create multiple wallets (up to 21) that will participate in buying tokens from the liquidity pool.  

4. Set Up the Lookup Table
Establish a Lookup Table to efficiently track transaction data.

5. Extend the Lookup Table & Simulate Transactions
Extend the Lookup Table and simulate each transaction that will be bundled together.

6. Bundle Transactions
Bundle the creation of the pool and up to 3 buying transactions from the 21 wallets.

7. Revoke Authorities & Burn Liquidity Pool
After completing the buy transactions, revoke mint and freeze authorities, and burn the liquidity pool (LP) tokens.


9. Sell Tokens in One Go
Sell all tokens at once using a bundle, across all 21 wallets, whenever you're ready.

10. Gather SOL from All Wallets
Finally, collect the SOL from all 21 wallets after the bundleâ€™s buy and sell actions are complete.
